# React Hooks Playground

Learning React Hooks — Notes from a Python/Django Dev

Started January 2020. Coming from backend (Python/Django/DRF).
React 16.13, Create React App.

## Why

All my projects are APIs. No frontend. Time to change that.
React seems to dominate (74% loved on StackOverflow 2019).
Hooks just came out in 16.8. Good time to start.

## Stack

- React 16.13
- Create React App
- JavaScript (no TypeScript yet, not sure I need it)

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
